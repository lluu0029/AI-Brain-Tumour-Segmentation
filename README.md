# AI Brain Tumour Segmentation

This project performs automated brain tumour segmentation using the BraTS 2020 dataset.

---

## Running the Code

The notebook `Demo_Code.ipynb` is **configured for Google Colab**. All file paths assume a Colab directory structure (`/content/...`), and it is recommended to run the notebook in Colab due to the size of the dataset (~40 GB).

---

## Dependencies

- A **Kaggle API key** (`kaggle.json`) is required to download the dataset directly from Kaggle when using `Demo_Code.ipynb`.
- Required Python libraries are installed automatically within the notebook.

---

## Dataset

- Dataset used for training: [BraTS20 Dataset (Training + Validation)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats20-dataset-training-validation)
